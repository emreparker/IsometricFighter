// Unity Isometric Fighting Game using Cursor IDE
// This project is a simple 3D isometric fighting game where the player can move, jump, and attack enemies.

// Project Context
// Players can walk, jump, and punch. There are two types of enemies: one dummy that takes hits and respawns, and one basic AI enemy that chases and damages the player.
// The project is in the early prototyping phase and uses Cursor for AI-assisted development and refactoring.

// Development Environment
// Language: C#
// Unity Version: 2023.2.x (3D Core template)

// Instructions
// Ensure player input feels responsive and animations sync properly.
// Keep all code modular and follow Unity best practices (e.g., avoid heavy logic in Update).
// Use physics-based movement with Rigidbody components.
// Scripts should be clean, commented, and suitable for beginners.

// Additional Notes
// You may ask the user (Emre) for clarification if you're unsure about mechanics or naming preferences.
